# 🌍 Transparent Educational Aid Distribution

This Web3 project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create a transparent, secure, and efficient platform for distributing educational aid. It addresses the real-world problem of mismanagement, fraud, and lack of transparency in educational aid distribution by ensuring funds and resources are tracked, allocated, and delivered to intended recipients with immutable records.

## ✨ Features

- 🏦 **Secure Fund Allocation**: Donors can allocate funds to specific educational programs or recipients.
- 📦 **Resource Tracking**: Track physical educational resources (e.g., textbooks, laptops) via unique identifiers.
- 🔍 **Transparency**: Publicly verifiable records of all transactions and distributions.
- ✅ **Recipient Verification**: Ensure only eligible recipients (e.g., verified schools or students) receive aid.
- 🛡️ **Fraud Prevention**: Prevent double-spending or misallocation of funds and resources.
- 📊 **Reporting**: Generate immutable reports for donors and auditors to track aid impact.

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Donors**:
- Register as a donor and deposit funds into the platform.
- Specify the recipient (e.g., a school or student) and purpose (e.g., scholarships, supplies).
- Track the distribution of funds/resources via blockchain records.

**For Recipients**:
- Register and verify eligibility (e.g., school accreditation or student enrollment).
- Receive funds or resources and provide proof of receipt.
- Access reports to confirm proper allocation.

**For Auditors**:
- Verify fund allocation, distribution, and receipt through public blockchain records.
- Access detailed reports for transparency and compliance.

## 📜 Smart Contracts

1. **DonorRegistry**: Registers donors and their details.
2. **RecipientRegistry**: Manages recipient eligibility and verification.
3. **FundAllocation**: Handles allocation of funds to specific recipients or programs.
4. **ResourceTracking**: Tracks physical resources using unique identifiers.
5. **DistributionRecord**: Logs all distributions for transparency.
6. **Verification**: Verifies recipient eligibility and prevents fraud.
7. **Reporting**: Generates reports for donors and auditors.
8. **Escrow**: Holds funds/resources until conditions are met.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy the Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.
2. **Register Donors/Recipients**: Donors and recipients register via the `DonorRegistry` and `RecipientRegistry` contracts.
3. **Allocate Funds/Resources**: Donors use the `FundAllocation` or `ResourceTracking` contracts to allocate aid.
4. **Track and Verify**: Use `DistributionRecord` and `Verification` contracts to track and confirm distributions.
5. **Generate Reports**: Access immutable reports via the `Reporting` contract.

## 📚 Example Workflow

1. A donor registers and deposits 10 STX for a school's textbook program.
2. The school, verified via `RecipientRegistry`, is allocated funds via `FundAllocation`.
3. Textbooks are assigned unique IDs in `ResourceTracking` and shipped to the school.
4. The school confirms receipt, logged in `DistributionRecord`.
5. Auditors verify the transaction via `Reporting` and `Verification` contracts.
